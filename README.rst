AutoScrape is an automated scraper of structured data from interactive
web pages. You point this scraper at a site, give it a little information
and structured data can then be extracted. No brittle, site-specific
programming necessary.

This is an implementation of the web scraping framework described in the
paper, `Robust Web Scraping in the Public Interest with AutoScrape <https://bxroberts.org/files/autoscrape.pdf>`__ and presented at
`Computation + Journalism Symposium 2019 <http://cplusj.org/>`__. This is
an experimental work in progress!

Currently there are a few ways to use  AutoScrape:

- via a full Web interface for scraping (see bottom of page, make sure to pull in the submodule!)
- as a local CLI python script
- as a simplified web scraping framework

Installation and running instructions are provided for both below.

Quickstart
----------

Two ways, easiest first.

::

    pip install autoscrape[all]
    autoscrape --backend requests --output outdir --maxdepth 2 https://bxroberts.org

This will install all dependencies for all backends and various options.

Or:

::

    git clone https://github.com/brandonrobertz/autoscrape-py
    cd autoscrape-py/
    pip install .[all]
    autoscrape --backend requests --output outdir --maxdepth 2 https://bxroberts.org

Either way, you can now use ``autoscrape`` from the command line.

Usage Examples
--------------

Here are some straightforward use cases for AutoScrape and how you'd use
the CLI tool to execute them. These, of course, assume you have the
dependencies installed.

Crawler Backends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two backends available for driving AutoScrape: ``requests``,
``selenium`` and ``warc``. The ``requests`` backend (the default) is based on the
Python requests library and is only capable of crawling sites and submitting
simple HTTP forms. For any interaction with forms or JavaScript powered
buttons, you'll need to use the ``selenium`` backend.

You can control the backened with the ``--backend`` option:

::

    autoscrape \
      --backend requests \
      --output requests_crawled_site \
      'https://some.page/to-crawl'

In order to use backends other than requests, you need to install
the proper dependencies. `pip install autoscrape[all]` will
install everything required for all backends/functionality, but
you can also install dependencies in isolation:

::
    Selenium backend:
    pip install autoscrape[selenium-backend]

    Crawl graph builder (for use in --save-graph)
    pip install autoscrape[graph]

    WARC backend:
    pip install autoscrape[warc-backend]

Note that for the Selenium backend, you need to install geckodriver or
chromedriver, depending if you're using Firefox or Chrome, respectively.
More information is below in the External Dependencies section.

Crawl
~~~~~

Crawl an entire website, saving all HTML and stylesheets (no
screenshots):

::

    autoscrape \
      --backend requests \
      --maxdepth -1 \
      --output crawled_site \
      'https://some.page/to-crawl'

Archive Page (Screenshot & Code)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Archive a single webpage, both code and full-content screenshot (PNG),
for future reference:

::

    autoscrape \
      --backend selenium \
      --full-page-screenshots \
      --load-images --maxdepth 0 \
      --save-screenshots --driver Firefox \
      --output archived_webpage \
      'https://some.page/to-archive'

Search Forms and Crawl Result Pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Query a web form, identified by containing the text "I'm a search form",
entering "NAME" into the first (0th) text input field and select January
20th, 1992 in the second (1st) date field. Then click all buttons with
the text "Next ->" to get all results pages:

::

    autoscrape \
      --backend selenium \
      --output search_query_data \
      --form-match "I'm a search form" \
      --input "i:0:NAME,d:1:1992-01-20" \
      --next-match "Next ->" \
      'https://some.page/search?s=newquery'

Setup for Standalone Local CLI
------------------------------

External Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to use the ``selenium`` backend for interactive crawling,
you need to have geckodriver installed. You can do that here:

::

    https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

Or through your package manager:

::
    apt install firefox-geckodriver

Your ``geckodriver`` needs to be compatible with your current version of
Firefox or you will get errors. If you install FF and the driver
through your package manager, you *should* be okay, but it's
not guaranteed. We have specific versions of both pinned in the
``Dockerfile``.

If you prefer to use Chrome, you will need the ChromeDriver (we've
tested using v2.41). It can be found in your distribution's package
manager or here:

::

    https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

Installing the remaining Python dependencies can be done using pip.

Pip Install Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next you need to set up your python virtual environment (Python 3.6
required) and install the Python dependencies:

::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Running Standalone Scraper
--------------------------

Environment Test Crawler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run a test to ensure your webdriver is set up correctly by
running the ``test`` crawler:

::

    ./autoscrape --backend selenium --show-browser [SITE_URL]

The ``test`` crawler will just do a depth-first click-only crawl of an
entire website. It will not interact with forms or POST data. Data will
be saved to ``./autoscrape-data/`` (the default output directory).

Manual Config-Based Scraper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Autoscrape has a manually controlled mode, similar to wget, except this
uses interactive capabilities and can input data to search forms, follow
"next page"-type buttons, etc. This functionality can be used either as
a standalone crawler/scraper or as a method to build a training set for
the automated scrapers.

Autoscrape manual-mode full options:

::

    AUTOSCRAPE - Interactively crawl, find searchable forms,
    input data to them and scrape data on the results, from an
    initial BASEURL.

    Usage:
        autoscrape [options] BASEURL

    General Options:
        --backend BACKEND
            The backend to use. Currently one of "selenium", "requests" or
            "warc".  The requests browser is only capable of crawling, but
            is approximately 2-3.5x faster. WARC is for emulating browsing
            through Common Crawl archival data.
            [default: selenium]

        --loglevel LEVEL
            Loglevel, note that DEBUG is extremely verbose.
            [default: INFO]

        --quiet
            This will silence all logging to console.

    Crawl-Specific Options:
        --maxdepth DEPTH
            Maximum depth to crawl a site (in search of form
            if the option --form-match STRING is specified,
            see below). Setting to 0 means don't crawl at all,
            all operations are limited to the BASEURL page.
            Setting to -1 means unlimited maximum crawl depth.
            [default: 10]

        --max-pages NUM
            Maximum number of unique pages, in total, to fetch.
            AutoScrape will stop crawling once this is hit.

        --leave-host
            By default, autoscrape will not leave the host given
            in the BASEURL. This option lets the scraper leave
            the host.

        --only-links MATCH_STREING
            A whitelist of links to follow. All others will
            be ignored. Can be a string or a regex with
            multiple strings to match separated by a pipe
            (|) character.

        --ignore-links MATCH_STRING
            This option can be used to remove any links matching
            MATCH_STRING (can be a regex or just a string match)
            from consideration for clicking. Accepts the same
            argument format as --only-links.

        --link-priority SORT_STRING
            A string to sort the links by. In this case, any link
            containing "SORT_STRING" will be clicked before any other
            links. In most cases you probably want to use the
            whitelist, --only-links, option.

        --ignore-extensions IGNORE_EXTENSIONS
            Don't click on or download URLs pointing to files with
            these extensions.

        --result-page-links MATCH_STRINGS_LIST
            If specified, AutoScrape will click on any links matching
            this string when it arrives on a search result page.

    Interactive Form Search Options:
        --form-match SEARCH_STRING
            The crawler will identify a form to search/scrape if it
            contains the specified string. If matched, it will be
            interactively scraped using the below instructions.

        --input INPUT_DESCRIPTION
            Interactive search descriptor. This describes how to
            interact with a matched form. The inputs are
            described in the following format:

            "c:0:True,i:0:atext,s:1:France:d:0:1991-01-20"

            A single-input type can be one of three types:
            checkbox ("c"), input box ("i"), option select
            ("s"), and date inputs ("d", with inputs in the
            "YYYY-MM-DD" format). The type is separated by a
            colon, and the input index position is next. (Each
            input type has its own list, so a form with one
            input, one checkbox, and one option select, will all
            be at index 0.) The final command, sepearated by
            another colon, describes what to do with the input.

            Multiple inputs are separated by a comma, so you can
            interact with multiple inputs before submitting the
            form.

            To illustrate this, the above command does the following:
                - first input checkbox is checked (uncheck is False)
                - first input box gets filled with the string "first"
                - second select input gets the "France" option chosen
                - first date input gets set to Jan 20, 1991

        --next-match NEXT_BTN_STRING
            A string to match a "next" button with, after
            searching a form.  The scraper will continue to
            click "next" buttons after a search until no matches
            are found, unless limited by the --formdepth option
            (see below). [default: next page]

        --formdepth DEPTH
            How deep the scraper will iterate, by clicking
            "next" buttons. Zero means infinite depth.
            [default: 0]

        --form-submit-natural-click
            Some webpages make clicking a link element difficult
            due to JavaScript onClick events. In cases where a
            click does nothing, you can use this option to get
            the scraper to emulate a mouse click over the link's
            poition on the page, activating any higher level JS
            interactions.

        --form-submit-wait SECONDS
            How many seconds to force wait after a submit to a form.
            This should be used in cases where the builtin
            wait-for-page-load isn't working properly (JS-heavy
            pages, etc). [default: 5]

    Webdriver-Specific and General Options:
        --load-images
            By default, images on a page will not be fetched.
            This speeds up scrapes on sites and lowers bandwidth
            needs. This option fetches all images on a page.

        --show-browser
            By default, we hide the browser during operation.
            This option displays a browser window, mostly
            for debugging purposes.

        --driver DRIVER
            Which browser to use. Current support for "Firefox",
            "Chrome", and "remote". [default: Firefox]

        --browser-binary PATH_TO_BROWSER
            Path to a specific browser binary. If left blank
            selenium will pull the browser found on your path.

        --remote-hub URI
            If using "remote" driver, specify the hub URI to
            connect to. Needs the proto, address, port, and path.
            [default: http://localhost:4444/wd/hub]

    WARC Options:
        --warc-directory PATH_TO_WARCS
            Path to the folder containing GZipped WARC files. These can be
            downloaded from Common Crawl. Required when using the "warc"
            backend.

        --warc-index-file PATH_TO_LEVELDB
            Path to the level DB database holding the URL-to-file
            index: URL => (filename, record_number)
            This will be generated from the WARCS in the --warc-directory
            speficied if it's not already. Required when using the "warc"
            backend.

    Data Saving Options:
        --output DIRECTORY_OR_URL
            If specified, this indicates where to save pages during a
            crawl. This directory will be created if it does not
            currently exist.  This directory will have several
            sub-directories that contain the different types of pages
            found (i.e., search_pages, data_pages, screenshots).
            This can also accept a URL (i.e., http://localhost:5000/files)
            and AutoScrape will POST to that endpoint with each
            file scraped.
            [default: autoscrape-data]

        --keep-filename
            By default, we hash the files in a scrape in order to
            account for dynamic content under a single-page app
            (SPA) website implmentation. This option will force
            the scraper to retain the original filename, from the
            URL when saving scrape data.

        --save-screenshots
            This option makes the scraper save screenshots of each
            page, interaction, and search. Screenshots will be
            saved to the screenshots folder of the output dir.

        --full-page-screenshots
            By default, we only save the first displayed part of the
            webpage. The remaining portion that you can only see
            by scrolling down isn't captured. Setting this option
            forces AutoScrape to scroll down and capture the entire
            web content. This can fail in certain circumstances, like
            in API output mode and should be used with care.

        --save-graph
            This option allows the scraper to build a directed graph
            of the entire scrape and will save it to the "graph"
            subdirectory under the output dir. The output file
            is a timestamped networkx pickled graph.

        --disable-style-saving
            By default, AutoScrape saves the stylesheets associated
            with a scraped page. To save storage, you can disable this
            functionality by using this option.

AutoScrape Web UI (Docker)
--------------------------

AutoScrape can be ran as a containerized cluster environment, where
scrapes can be triggered and stopped via API calls and data can be
streamed to this server.

This requires the `autoscrape-www <https://github.com/brandonrobertz/autoscrape-www>`__ submodule to be pulled:

::

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

This will pull the browser-based UI into the `www/` folder.

You need
`docker-ce <https://docs.docker.com/install/#server>`__ and
`docker-compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`__. Once you
have these dependencies installed, simply run:

::

    docker-compose build --pull
    docker-compose up

This will build the containers and launch a API server running on local
port 5000. More information about the API calls can be found in
``autoscrape-server.py``.

If you have make installed, you can simply run ``make start``.
